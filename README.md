## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linked List data structures** in **C**.  
It includes **singly linked lists** with basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science, ideal for dynamic memory management and efficient insertion/deletion operations.

---

## Features
- Create a **Singly Linked List**  
- Insert nodes at **beginning, end, or specific position**  
- Delete nodes from **beginning, end, or specific position**  
- Search for elements  
- Display the linked list  
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`

---

## Prerequisites
- C Compiler (e.g., `gcc`)  
- Basic understanding of pointers in C  
- Git (optional, for version control)

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dulanachathurma/C-Programming.git
